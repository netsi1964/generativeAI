# Project Analysis

This project is a static website that serves as a gallery for images generated by various AI image generation services.

## Main Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase and compare images created by different AI art generators. It appears to be a personal project for experimenting with and documenting the results of various text-to-image models.

## Tech Stack

### Website

The website is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no signs of a major front-end framework like React or Vue.

### Tooling

The project uses TypeScript for its scripting needs, which are run using the Deno runtime. These scripts are responsible for generating the HTML pages and other project assets.

### Image Generation Services

The project includes images from a wide variety of services, including:

*   DALL-E 3
*   Midjourney
*   Imagen 3.0
*   Leonardo.ai
*   Clipdrop.co
*   Grok-3
*   Lexica.art
*   Playground.com
*   RunwayML
*   FastSDXL

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

*   **`images/`**: This is the main directory containing all the generated images, with subdirectories for each AI service.
*   **`prompts/`**: This directory contains HTML files, likely used as templates or to store the prompts used to generate the images.
*   **`services/`**: This directory contains HTML files that likely describe or link to the different AI image generation services.
*   **`static/`**: This directory contains the website's static assets, such as JavaScript files and CSS.
*   **`scripts/`**: This directory contains helper scripts for managing the project.
*   **`tools/`**: This directory contains additional tools, possibly for working with prompts or styles.
*   **Root Directory**: The root of the project contains the main `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, and a number of TypeScript files (`.ts`) that are used to generate the site's content.

## Key Components

*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point for the website.
*   **`style.css`**: The main stylesheet for the website.
*   **`generate-*.ts` files**: These are the core of the project's build process. They are responsible for generating the HTML pages for the image gallery, prompts, and services.
*   **`config.ts`**: This file likely contains configuration options for the project, such as the list of AI services or image dimensions.
*   **`images/` subdirectories**: Each subdirectory in the `images` directory represents a different AI image generation service and contains the images generated by that service.

## Deno Tooling Usage

### The `deno.json` file

This project uses a `deno.json` file to manage dependencies and define tasks. This file serves as a central configuration for the Deno runtime, making it easier to manage the project's scripts and their dependencies.

### When to use the Deno tasks

You should run the Deno tasks whenever you make changes to the project that require the website to be regenerated. This includes:

*   Adding new images to the `images/` directory.
*   Adding or modifying prompts in the `prompts/` directory.
*   Updating the `config.ts` file.
*   Changing any of the `generate-*.ts` scripts.

### How to use the Deno tasks

To run the Deno tasks, you will need to have Deno installed on your system. You can then run the tasks from the root of the project directory using the `deno task` command. Here are the available tasks:

*   `deno task index`: Generates the main `index.html` file.
*   `deno task prompts`: Generates the HTML files for each prompt.
*   `deno task rss`: Generates the RSS feed.
*   `deno task services`: Generates the HTML files for each service.
*   `deno task images`: Generates images using the Vertex AI Imagen model.
*   `deno task update`: Runs all the generation scripts in the correct order.

For example, to regenerate the entire website, you can run the following command:

```bash
deno task update
```

In summary, this is a well-organized static website for showcasing and comparing AI-generated images. The use of Deno for scripting allows for a modern and secure TypeScript-based build process.
